 * @brief		This function serves to raise the flash reset voltage to 2.1V. If flash trim takes effect, the vbat voltage of chip can not be lower than 2.1V.

 * @note        Flash specification states that the default reset voltage of flash is 1.0V.
 *              Important description: The return value of this function is "0", which does not mean that flash trim is successful.Flash trim will take effect
 * 				after flash is powered off and powered on again.
 * 				Risk description:This function needs to use delay function and disable interrupt.The user must determine
 * 				how to use this function and better use it once,otherwise it may cause risks.Dont call this function anymore if flash trim takes effect.
 * 				Pay attention to the threshold of battery voltage detection and do not call this function in a low voltage state.
 * 				Flash cannot be powered off while calling this function.
